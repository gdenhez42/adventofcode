# Advent of code

I got challenged by my colleages to solve the advent of code challenges! This repo is meant to contain my solutions so I can get reviews from them and improve my programming skills.

## 2022

In the [2022](./2022) edition, we needed to use a different programming language each day.

## 2023

In the [2023](./2023), we decided to learn more rust so the challenges had to be programmed in rust.

## 2024

We skipped 2024 because we were lazy.

## 2025

In the [2025](./2025) edition, we also got lazy and decided to do it in c# because it is the language we know best. The hardest part for me was never the language to begin with, but the problem solving part. Still, I would not redo a bash or foxpro day.
