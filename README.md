# Advent of code

I got challenged by my colleages to solve the advent of code challenges! In the 2022 edition, we needed to use a different programming language each day. In the 2023, we decided to learn more rust.

This repo is meant to contain my solutions so I can get reviews from my colleages and improve my programming skills.
