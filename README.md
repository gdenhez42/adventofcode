# Advent of code

I got challenged by my colleages to solve the advent of code challenges in 2022! They also added an extra layer of difficulty: one different programming language each day! It took me a while (more than 25 days), I am not proud of all my solutions, but at least I did it!

This repo is meant to contain my solutions so I can get reviews from my colleages and improve my programming skills.
